Understand how to write a README.md using markdown basics and introduce the concept of literate programming with Quarto.

## Lesson Outline

    -   Allows combining markdown, code, and code output (tables, plots, etc)
    -   Wide variety of outputs: html, pdf, word, and more
    -   Use cases:
        -   Notebook
        -   Share results with collaborators
        -   Presentations
        -   Reproducible manuscripts

-   How does it work?

    -   qmd -\> knitr -\> md -\> pandoc -\> word, pdf, html, etc.

-   Anatomy of a .Qmd

    -   Look familiar if you've used RMarkdown

    -   Code chunks with R, Python, Julia, or other code

-   Create .Qmd and play

-   Demo visual editor

    -   Switch back and forth

    -   "Add anything" menu with {{< kbd cmd-/ >}}
