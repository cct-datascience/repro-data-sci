## Review of last lesson

-   What questions do you have?
-   What happened as you were trying to organize a research compendium?
    -   Victories?
    -   Stumbling blocks?

## Literate Programming

-   Code is interwoven with human-language notes, comments, and documentation.

-   Some kind of "engine" handles executing the code and weaving together prose, code, and results.

-   Allows for extended comments on code and reproducible reports and manuscripts

# {{< iconify simple-icons:quarto >}} Quarto

## What is Quarto?

"An open-source scientific and technical publishing system"

::: incremental
-   Mix markdown, code, and the output of code

-   Produce beautifully formatted documents in a variety of formats (html, Word, pdf, etc.)

-   Data analysis notebook

-   Presentations for collaborators

-   Reproducible manuscripts

-   ...and more!
:::

## How does Quarto work?

-   Command line tool, not an R package, but works well with RStudio

::: notes
knitr or jupyter are used to convert code chunks into markdown, pandoc converts markdown into output

## Create a new Quarto document

In RStudio: File \> New File \> Quarto Document

Click "Render" to see the rendered output

## Anatomy of a .Qmd file

```` {.markdown code-line-numbers="|1-7|9-15|10-11|17-19|21-23|" filename="myreport.qmd"}

```{{r}}

## Data

My data source is the [gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/) dataset.

```{{r}}
head(gapminder)

::: notes
If this looks familiar to RMarkdown users, that's because Quarto was built on lessons learned from developing RMarkdown.
It includes all the features of RMarkdown and more.

## YAML

"Yet another markup language"

-   Commonly used for configuration files

-   `key: value` pairs

-   Nesting indicated by indentation with 2 spaces

## Markdown

Markdown is a "markup language" that let's you write plain text to indicate formatting.
For example:

-   `**bold text**` becomes **bold text**

-   `~~strikethrough~~` becomes ~~strikethrough~~

-   `$E = mc^2$` becomes $E = mc^2$

-   `[link](https://www.google.com)` becomes [link](https://www.google.com)

-   `` `code()` `` becomes `code()`

Check **Help \> Markdown quick reference** in RStudio

## Common markdown pitfalls

Spaces between elements matter!
How would you fix each of these?

``` markdown
###Heading 3
```

###Heading 3

. . .

``` markdown
Colors:
- red
- green
```

Colors: - red - green

. . .

``` markdown
1.Number one
2.Number two
```

1.Number one 2.Number two

## Common markdown pitfalls

Spaces within elements don't matter!

``` markdown
This     sentence still  gets    rendered  correctly!
```

This sentence still gets rendered correctly!

``` markdown
Single line breaks don't separate paragraphs.
See?

You need two line breaks for that!
```

You need two line breaks for that!

## Code

-   Code chunks can be R, Python, or other languages

-   If R, code is executed by `knitr` engine, otherwise by `jupyter`

-   Chunk options as YAML (`#| key: value`) modify execution behavior or output formatting

## Our turn

-   Create a new Quarto Document

-   Practice editing and rendering

-   Explore the Visual editor mode

-   Add citations and cross-references

## README.md

-   Your README.md uses a simple version of markdown, and will get formatted nicely once we put it on GitHub
-   You can use the visual editor on .md files also
-   If you need to have code executed in your README, you can use `format: gfm` for "GitHub Flavored Markdown"

## Your tasks

-   Use Quarto to create a report for your compendium

-   Try converting a R script with a lot of comments into a Quarto document instead
