title: "Drop-in / Q&A"
---

We asked learners to vote on the following topics for a mini-lesson for the last session before the show-and-tell session:

1.  working with dates and times in R
2.  working with strings and factors in R
3.  packaging complicated workflows (analyses that include multiple scripts, more than just R code, etc.)
4.  I would like the entire time for a question/answer session

They overwhelmingly chose #3

# Targets

-   Show slides from [part 1](https://viz.datascience.arizona.edu/targets-slides/slides.html#/part-1-context) of previous targets workshop
-   Demonstrate `tar_visnetwork()`, `tar_make()`, `tar_read()` and what happens when you invalidate a target using demo repo: <https://github.com/cct-datascience/targets-demo/tree/with-targets>
-   Explore a medium complexity `targets` project on GitHub: <https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/mpx-diagnosis>
    -   *maybe* try to reproduce it
-   Mention that `targets` can be configured to work on UA HPC to run individual targets as SLURM jobs or multiple cores with Open on Demand.
    -   Open on Demand example: <https://github.com/cct-datascience/targets-uahpc>
