## Why share code?

<!--# pull quote from https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3222221/v1 -->

## Reproducible computational environments

Congrats!
Your code is reproducible!
But what about ....

-   in 3 years when an R package is updated with breaking changes?

-   on a different operating system with different versions of system libraries?

Capture the **computational environment** for ultimate reproducibility

## Capture R package state with `renv`

-   how renv works

-   how to set it up

-   when to set it up

-   how to use a renv package

-   quick demo

## Capture entire computational environment with `Docker`

-   How docker works

-   Theoretically how to set it up

-   Theoretically how to use a docker container with reproducible code

## Hold up, what *is* reproducibility again?

Tools like `renv` and Docker improve the numerical reproducibility, but add extra barriers.
Producing accessible and understandable code is an important aspect of reproducibility, so need to balance that with capturing computational environments.

-   Provide instructions on how to troubleshoot or disable `renv` if it's giving folks trouble

-   Provide code in a GitHub repo *in addition* to inside of a Docker container

-   Provide instructions on how to run code in README

## Getting Credit with Zenodo

-   Release code & data with a DOI

-   Archive backed by CERN---not going anywhere!

-   Version releases so you can release code before it is finalized (e.g. to provide to reviewers or alongside a pre-print)

-   Easy integration with GitHub

## Setup

-   Zenodo does poor job at reading metadata from GitHub alone---provide a CITATION.cff file!

-   `cffr` package helps

-   show how to do that and walk though it

-   show how citation shows up on GitHub now

## Archive

-   Show how to link Zenodo and Github repo

-   Show how to make a release (maybe can use sandbox or something for this? or maybe just show parts separately? maybe a student is ready to make a release and can demo?)
