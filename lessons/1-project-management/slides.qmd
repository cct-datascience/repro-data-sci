## The Whole Picture

::: callout-note
## A (usually fictional) story:

You read a paper and think "I bet I could apply their analysis methods to my work!" You click a DOI link in their Data Availability section.
It opens to a web page where you can download a folder with R code, data, and documentation.
You open the folder in R Studio and you are prompted to install all the packages you need to run the code.
You open the analysis code script and hit "run".
All the code runs perfectly with no errors, creating all the figures, tables, and statistics used in the paper.
You scroll through the well-formatted R code and understand from the authors' comments exactly what the code does and how to adapt it to your work.
:::

. . .

We want to help you make this story a reality for someone!

Including future you!

## Syllabus & Workshop Materials

Workshop series website:\

## Reproducibility Colloquium

Format: short talks on one or two ways you've improved a project

***Your task for this week:***

-   Pick a *real* project to give a "reproducibility renovation" over the next 5 weeks

-   Every week, you'll make improvements and document your progress for your talk

::: notes
Take before and after screenshots!
Keep track of every time you thank your past self!
:::

## Screen Setup {{< fa desktop >}} {{< fa laptop >}} {.smaller}

-   Dual monitors will be *very* helpful
-   Virtual desktops ("Spaces" in macOS) also helpful
-   Let us know if you do not have access to a second monitor

# Creating a Research Compendium

## Learning Objectives

1.  Understand the benefits of organizing a project as a research compendium
2.  Use RStudio projects to create self-contained reproducible projects
3.  Use best practices for organizing files in a project
4.  **Create a "toy" research compendium you can use throughout this series**

::: notes
Clarify that learners will have 1) their *real* project that they are improving and taking notes on for the reproducibility colloquium **and** 2) a *toy* project that they'll come back to every Tuesday and Thursday
:::

## 

> A research compendium is a collection of all digital parts of a research project including data, code, texts (protocols, reports, questionnaires, meta data).
> The collection is created in such a way that reproducing all results is straightforward.
>

. . .

("project" could be a single manuscript or multiple manuscripts that use the same data or code—that's up to you to decide)

## Research Compendium Best Practices

::: incremental
-   Treat raw data as read-only

-   Use scripts to "clean" and wrangle data

-   Treat generated outputs as disposable

-   Put data, code, and outputs in different folders
:::

::: notes
A couple reasons to use scripts over, say, Excel: the cleaning steps are the code; avoid introducing errors by opening things in Excel with it's eager auto-formatting.
:::

## What goes in a compendium?

Ideally, *everything related to that project*

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Data
-   Code
-   Lab notebook
-   Notes about analyses
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Outputs
-   Documentation / metadata
-   Reports / presentations
-   Manuscripts
:::
:::

## Basic compendium structure {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](compendium-basic.png){width="398"}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
::: incremental
-   Short machine and human readable name
-   Separate folders for "raw" and "clean" data
-   `gdd-thresholds.Rproj` file is created by RStudio
-   `R/` folder contains all code to reproduce analysis. Could be named `scripts/` or something else
-   R scripts are numbered with two digits so alphabetic sorting = numeric sorting
-   README.md is a markdown (plain text) document (we'll get to README's later)
:::
:::
:::

## RStudio projects

-   Never worry about `setwd()` or `getwd()` again! Your compendium is *always* your working directory.
-   Switch between many active projects. RStudio remembers where you left off.

::: callout-tip
Don't worry if you don't know what a **working directory** is, Renata will talk more about it next week!
:::

DEMO: create a new RStudio Project

## Settings for Success

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
![](rstudio-settings.png){fig-alt="image of RStudio global settings pane with the \"Workspace\" and \"History\" sections highlighted.  None of the boxes are checked and the dropdown for \"Save workspace to .RData on exit\" is set to \"never\"" fig-align="left"}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
::: incremental
-   Fresh start ensures reproducibility

-   If your analysis relies on saving your environment in .RData, there are better solutions
:::
:::
:::

## Build your (toy) research compendium

Using the RStudio file pane OR Finder (macOS) / File Explorer (Windows)

-   Create folders for `data/`, `R/`, `output/` and `notes/`
-   Download the [gapminder dataset](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/data/gapminder_data.csv) and place it in your `data/` folder
-   Create a text file called `README.md`

## README

A README is a plain text document in your research compendium that contains:

::: incremental
-   Brief project summary

-   Project status (e.g. work-in-progress, published)

-   Who is involved

-   If re-use is allowed and how to give credit

-   Structure of repo (which files do what?)

-   Instructions on how to reproduce results
:::

-   <https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/amphibian_trade>

-   <https://github.com/atredennick/size-environment>

::: callout-note
We will revisit how to make a README formatted for GitHub in week 3

# Getting Help

## Getting Help

Every week, we'll try to point you to places to look for help when you're stuck or to dive more deeply into the topics covered.

Asking a question in our Slack channel is always great place to start!

## A note on AI

-   Generative AI / large language models (LLMs) can generate code, explain code, or suggest code improvements

-   GenAI/LLMs have been described as "hallucinating", "[stochastic parrots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_parrot)", and even "bullshit machines" [@hicks2024]

-   Making things up is fundamental feature of GenAI and will likely always be a problem

## A note on AI

-   Beginners have difficulty spotting mistakes in AI generated code solutions [@kabir2024]

-   Struggling and frustration are important parts of learning—short circuiting these steps does you a disservice in the long run

-   AI presents a host of [ethical](https://mashable.com/article/chat-gpt-open-ai-workers-exploitation), [environmental](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/05/1084417/ais-carbon-footprint-is-bigger-than-you-think/), and [copyright](https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/08/midjourney_openai_copyright/) issues to consider

## Takeaways

::: incremental
-   Structure files in self-contained projects or "research compendia"
-   Put data in a separate folder and never edit raw data!
-   Naming things well is difficult but worth spending time on
-   Use RStudio projects with one project per compendium
-   Include a README file in each compendium
:::

## Your Tasks

-   Choose a project you will focus on for your "reproducibility renovation"
-   Does your project follow the file naming and organizations strategies we discussed?
-   If not, re-organize and re-name to improve it
-   Create or improve a README for your project
