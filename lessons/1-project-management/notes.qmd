title: "Project Management and Coding Best Practices"
---

#### Objective

Learners will learn about and practice managing their projects using file structure and RStudio projects, and about current best practices and style guides for R coding.

#### Installation & materials

1.  [Slides](slides.qmd)
2.  [Software Carpentry Introduction to R and RStudio episode](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/01-rstudio-intro)
3.  [Software Carpentry Project Management with RStudio episode](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/02-project-intro)
4.  [Software Carpentry Best Practices for Writing R Code](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/06-best-practices-R)

##### Modifications

-   RStudio
    -   Can skip most of the Introduction to R and RStudio lesson, but may be helpful as a refresher.
    -   Focus on setting up RStudio for reproducibility---don't save or restore workspace, restart R session often.
    -   Show command pallette with {{< kbd mac=Cmd-Shift-P win=Control-Shift-P >}}
-   Project management
    -   Do "Best practices for project organization" including yellow "Tip: Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing" box
    -   Then "A possible solution" section about R projects
    -   Include splitting scripts up into modular chunks to promote reproducibility and avoiding rerunning time-intensive data cleaning
-   Coding best practices
    -   Condensed into a [single slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WNNHQtzq2IUMA0RPz9pwgDCTMLzMIxqQhQsTuR0m_BY/edit#slide=id.geda00d7b2c_0_0)

#### Teaching notes

-   Include how R projects promotes reproducibility, by being able to save scripts and close them or entire project

#### Homework

Apply one or more of the organizing principles of a research compendium to an existing research project.
