## Objectives

-   Know your options for finding help

-   Understand how to create a minimal reproducible example to get better help

## Live coding/discussion: options for finding help

-   `--help` flag
-   `man` pages
-   `?` in R
-   Package websites (found with google or through CRAN page)
    -   These often are the same material as help files + vignettes, but easier to read and examples are rendered on web
-   StackOverflow
    -   People aren't always the friendliest, but making a reprex helps you get good answers
-   Minimal reproducible examples with `reprex`
    -   Demo RStudio addin
-   ChatGPT
    -   Not recommended for beginners!
    -   Sometimes (\~50% by some estimates) gives the wrong answer, difficult to spot mistakes if you're a beginner
