## README

`README.md` is the landing page for your GitHub repo, and the first place to look for help understanding it.

::: incremental
-   Brief project summary

-   Project status (just an experiment, WIP, archived?)

-   How to give credit (e.g. if it is associated with a published paper)

-   Structure of repo (which files do what?)

-   Instructions on how to reproduce results

## Markdown

Markdown is a "markup language" that let's you write plain text to indicate formatting.
For example:

-   `**bold text**` becomes **bold text**

-   `~~strikethrough~~` becomes ~~strikethrough~~

-   `$E = mc^2$` becomes $E = mc^2$

-   `[link](https://www.google.com)` becomes [link](https://www.google.com)

-   `` `code()` `` becomes `code()`

## Common markdown pitfalls

Spaces between elements matter!
How would you fix each of these?

``` markdown
###Heading 3
```

###Heading 3

``` markdown
Colors:

. . .

``` markdown
1.Number one
2.Number two
```

1.Number one 2.Number two

## Common markdown pitfalls

Spaces within elements don't matter!

``` markdown
This     sentence still  gets    rendered  correctly!
```

This sentence still gets rendered correctly!

``` markdown
Single line breaks don't separate paragraphs.
See?

You need two line breaks for that!

# Quarto

## What is Quarto?

"An open-source scientific and technical publishing system"

::: incremental
-   Mix markdown, code, and the output of code

-   Produce beautifully formatted documents in a variety of formats (html, Word, pdf, etc.)

-   Data analysis notebook

-   Presentations for collaborators

-   Reproducible manuscripts

-   ...and more!
:::

## How does Quarto work?

-   Command line tool, not an R package, but works well with RStudio

::: notes
knitr or jupyter are used to convert code chunks into markdown, pandoc converts markdown into output

library(gapminder)
```

## Data

My data source is the [gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/) dataset.

```{{r}}

::: notes
If this looks familiar to RMarkdown users, that's because Quarto was built on lessons learned from developing RMarkdown.
It includes all the features of RMarkdown and more.
