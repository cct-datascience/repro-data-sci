## Objective

Learners will fork and clone a repository on GitHub and use branches to open pull requests.

<!--# Would like to add a bit about getting help and making a reprex.  This might be a good lesson to do it in? -->

## Installation & materials

1.  [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oKZ2VK50_CW90Um_iOJ8D6KEPgvapqYvXBFMlx0_aiw/edit)
2.  Workshop [repository](https://github.com/az-digitalag/data-sci-workshop)
3.  [Software Carpentry Version Control with Git episode #8](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/08-collab)

### Review

If anyone connected a local repository to GitHub, share how that went.
Ask students to navigate to previous repository, amend an existing file, and practice an add-commit-push cycle.

### Modifications

-   The only part of #8 that was taught was cloning a forked repository. Ask students to fork an instructor-created repository, then clone locally. This will be the repo for downstream files.
-   Use `git remote add upstream xxxx` to connect repo to upstream. If time permits, demonstrate a pull request (PR).
-   Share [diagram](https://www.tomasbeuzen.com/post/git-fork-branch-pull/) of relationships between the remotes (upstream and origin) and local
-   Demonstrate pull requests on GitHub
-   Show how distinct units of work can be separately submitted via branches

## Teaching notes

-   Have students fork a `cct-datascience` repo as an example of a real research compendium
-   Easy to check on learner progress by looking for who has and hasn't forked repo

## Homework

Skim the **Analyses** section of [tidyverse R style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org).
What practice or guideline was new to you?

Also, explore the upstream `cct-datascience` repo.
What practices do you notices that are new or different from your own?

<!--# practice making a reprex and pasting into Slack? -->
