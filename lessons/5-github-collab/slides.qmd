1.  A collection of files tracked by git
2.  A snapshot of the state of a repository
3.  `git` \_\_\_ is used to tell git to track a file
4.  For example, a repo on GitHub
5.  `git` *\_\_\_\_* is used to synchronize changes on your computer with a remote

## Review

Did anyone add a repo to GitHub?
What difficulties did you encounter?

## Collaborating with GitHub

::: notes
A GitHub repo can be used to coordinate collaboration

If two people have permissions, both can push changes to the repo

Ask for a volunteer and give them permission to push to a repo
:::

## Example repo

-   Everyone practice cloning this example repo as a new RStudio project: <!--# TODO: add link -->

-   Need one volunteer to edit the README.md and practice commit + push

## Dealing with Conflicts

-   What happens when two people make conflicting edits to a file and push them?

-   Creates a *merge conflict*

    ![](push_error.png)

## Ok, try `git pull`

![](pull_error.png)

## Merge, rebase, fast-forward??

-   These are alternative ways to deal with conflicts---we won't get into the deatils

-   For now, we recommend you stick with the "merge" option

. . .

Use:

``` bash
git config pull.rebase false
```

Or, if you want to set this option for all future repos too

``` bash
git config --global pull.rebase false
```

## Fixing a Merge Conflict

![](merge_conflict.png)

-   Resolve the conflict however you want (i.e. keep one of the two sections)

-   Delete all lines with `<<<<<<<`, `>>>>>>>`, or `=======`

-   Save and commit

::: notes
Let's have a round of applause for our volunteer!

## Avoid merge conflicts by working on branches

Each person works on a "branch"---an independent series of commits that can be merged back into the "main" branch.

```{mermaid}
gitGraph
       commit
       commit
       branch person_1
       commit
       commit
       commit
       checkout main
       branch person_2
       commit
       commit
       checkout main
       merge person_1
       merge person_2
       commit
       
```

## Working on a Branch

-   Make a new branch with your name using RStudio's Git pane

-   Commit changes and push to your branch

-   View changes on GitHub

## Pull Requests

A request to merge changes into the main branch

-   Need another volunteer to share screen and be guided through making a pull request

-   This time, everyone can follow along!

## Forks {.smaller}

What if you don't have permission to push to a GitHub repo but you want to contribute?
Make a fork!

## Collaborating with Forks

To contribute to a repo you don't have push permission for:

1.  **Fork** the repo to your own GitHub
2.  **Clone** the fork to your local computer
3.  Make **commits** (ideally on a **branch**)
4.  Make a **pull request** to the upstream repo

::: callout-tip
## Exercise

In pairs, practice this workflow to make a PR to our example repo
