## Objective

Learners will share their local repository on GitHub and learn how to sync some files while ignoring others systematically.
Learners will practice developing new code on branches.

## Installation & materials

1.  [Slides](slides.qmd)
2.  [Software Carpentry Version Control with Git episode #6](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/06-ignore)
3.  GitHub authentication with PAT using [Jenny Bryan's Git book chapter 9](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html) (follow `usethis::git_sitrep()`)
4.  [Software Carpentry Version Control with Git episode #7](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/07-github)
5.  [Software Carpentry branching add-on](http://erdavenport.github.io/git-lessons/10-branching)

### Review

If anyone turned a folder into a repository, share how that went.
Ask students to navigate to previous repository, add new R file, and practice an add-commit cycle.

### Modifications

-   Provide a large .csv file, ask students to move into pilot-analyses repo within a data folder using cd and filepaths
-   If RStudio project was initialized as a git repo, should already have `.gitignore`. View and explain and practice adding something.
-   Go with HTTPS + PAT setup, not SSH, but still mention SSH.
-   Connect local git repo to GitHub with `usethis::use_github()`
-   Create new repository entitled `repro-DS-workshop` on GitHub; can include README, license, and .gitignore. Clone locally to wherever course materials are organized
-   Show how checking out a branch literally changes the local files

## Teaching notes

-   Practice another add-commit cycle after creating the .gitignore
-   Introduce the add-commit-push cycle

## Homework

Connect a personal repository to GitHub.
Practice `usethis::use_git()` and `usethis::use_github()`.
