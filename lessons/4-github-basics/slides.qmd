## Review & Homework

-   Turn folder into git repo with `git init`

    -   Save changes to files with `git add` and `git commmit`

-   If you turned another project into a repo, how did it go?

## Today's goals

1.  Learn how to tell git to ignore files
2.  Put a local repo on GitHub
3.  Use `git push` and `git pull` to synchronize with GitHub
4.  Use branches for new work

## Ignoring files

-   If you created an RStudio project with git enabled, you should have a top-level `.gitignore`

## Sharing with GitHub

::: notes
-   All contributors have a local copy of the repo.
-   You might also have a copy in multiple places (on multiple computers, on university HPC).
-   GitHub has a central repo that allows you to synchronize and merge work from multiple sources.
-   You can also access the repo through github.com web UI
