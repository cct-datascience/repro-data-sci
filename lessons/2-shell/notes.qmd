title: "Using the Shell"
---

#### Objective

Learners should be comfortable with their file structure and navigating around it using command line commands in RStudio Terminal pane.

#### Installation & materials

1.  [Slides](slides.qmd)
2.  [macOS git installation](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
3.  [Windows git installation](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (detailed step-by-step [here](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#setup))
4.  [Software Carpentry Unix Shell episode #1](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/01-intro)
5.  [Software Carpentry Unix Shell episode #2](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir)
6.  [Software Carpentry Unix Shell episode #3](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create) (time permitting)

##### Modifications

-   Use terminal window within RStudio as command line interface
    -   Start with a brief overview of RStudio panes
    -   Only need to use Terminal and Files tabs
    -   Emphasize that Files tab is analogous to Finder (macOS), File Explorer (Windows)
-   Skip all exercises, including "Nelle" example
-   Mention Zsh, which is the default shell for recent versions of macOS and has `%` as the default prompt instead of `$`.
-   At beginning of episode #2, explain file path using example from instructor's file system
-   Can also use example diagram for file system using instructor's

#### Teaching notes

-   Emphasize purposes for learning shell
    -   Helpful for using git and GitHub
    -   Easier to deal with installation problems
    -   Understanding file structure and file paths
-   Need to install git initially for Windows users to have shell commands
    -   Separate into 2 breakout rooms to install Git for Windows and macOS
-   macOS comes with Bash or Zsh for shell. Use time with mac users to check if they have git already
    -   can check with `which git` or `git --version`
    -   `git --version` may in fact prompt macOS users to install xcode command line tools, which comes with git.
    -   Restart RStudio after installation
    -   For Windows, open RStudio Tools/Global Options/Terminal and make sure GitBash is selected
    -   For macOS, have them select Bash (for now at least)
-   Download shell-lesson-data.zip to `Desktop/` location; this won't be referenced in later lessons
-   Unzipping shell-lesson-data.zip through point-and-click in the RStudio Files tab does not work consistently across machines; recommend unzipping on the command line with `unzip`
    -   Once unzipped, have everyone share absolute file path to location of file

#### Homework

Create diagram, with pen and paper or digitally, of their own file system.
