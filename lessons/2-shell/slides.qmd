# Review of last week

-   What happened as you were trying to re-organize projects or R code?
    -   Victories?
    -   Stumbling blocks?

# Learning objectives

-   Understand the what and why of the shell
-   Use the shell to navigate your computer's file system
-   Use R projects to simplify file system navigation
-   Know your options for finding help

# What is the shell?

-   Command-line interface, in contrast to a GUI

# Why learn the shell?

-   Be able to work with tools that don't have a GUI
-   Batch large tasks (e.g. renaming files)
-   Interact with remote computers like the University HPC

# Shell in this workshop

-   git/GitHub (next 2 lessons)
-   Navigating your file system
-   Quarto (lesson 9)

# Let's get set up!

-   macOS comes with a shell (usually Bash or Zsh) built-in

-   Windows need to install GitBash (includes Bash shell and git, which we will use later)

-   Breakout rooms

    -   Mac users go with Eric
    -   Windows users go with Renata

# Data download

-   Download `shell-lesson-data.zip`
    -   Instructions here: <https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/index.html#download-files>
-   Save it to your Desktop and unzip it.

# Coding time

-   RStudio panes
-   Set up Terminal in RStudio
-   Navigation using Terminal and Files pane

# Example file system

# Syntax of a shell command

# Coding time

-   Synchronize working directories between Terminal, Files Pane, and R working directory

# Coding time

-   Use an R project to simplify working directories
-   Copy `shell_lesson_data` to your R project

# Getting help

``` bash
man ls
```

# Getting help

``` bash
git --help
```

# Beware of stochastic parrots

-   LLMs don't *understand*, but are good at mimicry
-   Use with care:
    -   May be wrong
    -   May be inconsistent

# Beware of stochastic parrots

-   Tools like ChatGPT pose ethical issues
    -   Plagiarism
    -   Labor conditions
    -   Inputs may be sent to parent companies

# Getting help: fellow humans

# Takeaways

-   The shell is a command-line interface to the computer
-   The file system the shell sees is the *same* as your File Explorer tab
-   We can use the shell from the Terminal pane in RStudio
-   Find help from built-in manual pages, Google, (maybe) AI tools, or community

# Homework for next time

-   Read ["Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?"](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/)
-   Create a diagram of your file system and note your most frequently used directories
