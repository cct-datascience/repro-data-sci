# Shell Commands

-   Be able to work with tools that don't have a GUI

-   Batch large tasks (e.g. renaming files)

-   Interact with remote computers like the University HPC

## Installation

-   macOS comes with a shell (usually Bash or Zsh) built-in

-   Windows need to install GitBash (includes Bash shell and git, which we will use later)

## `pwd`---print working directory

```{bash}
pwd
```
