## Objective

Learn how to reproducibly clean, summarize, and reorganize dataframes using tidyverse R packages.

## Installation & materials

1.  [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YoVpsCq6MWv6TYiBil79b4X_qGRUiviYmjZPBEz7WqE/edit#slide=id.p)

### Modifications

-   Explain data.frames and types of vectors, but skip over exercises on coercion and factors
-   Clarify difference between `==` and `%in%`, including that no warning or error given for `==` that induces vector recycling
-   End with saving script and doing an add-commit-push cycle to sync local repository with GitHub repository

### Teaching notes

-   Have students install each package separately rather than as the tidyverse---can be important to know which functions come from which packages

### Homework

None
