# Review

# Warm-up: create a branch for today's work

# Learning objectives

-   Understand how R stores different data types
-   Know what the tidyverse is, how it differs from base R, and the philosophy behind using it here.
-   Use tidyverse packages (`dplyr` and `tidyr`) to work with data in R.
-   Practice tracking our work in git

# Why learn data management in R?

-   Reproducible workflows
-   Reduce repetition

# What is the tidyverse? Why use it?

-   (visual of the tidyverse)
-   Flexible and readable code
-   Consistent, widely-used formatting and syntax

# Installing packages

```         
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("tidyr")
```
