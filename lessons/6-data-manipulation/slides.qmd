## Warm-up

Create a branch for today's work.

::: callout-note
Create this branch from a repo you own, *not* the demo from Tuesday!

We might need to create a repo for R scripting for this workshop.

## Learning objectives

-   Understand the principles of "tidy data"
-   Use tidyverse packages (`dplyr` and `tidyr`) to work with data in R.
-   Practice tracking our work in git

## What is "tidy data"?

[Lowndes and Horst say it so beautifully.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1N7hKepabvl9OrHjvGJWPjUsfzVdB5xzV5AsFndgSwms/edit#slide=id.p)

## The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)

[![](tidyverse.png)](https://www.tidyverse.org/)

## The "tidyverse"

-   ✨ Common structure and syntax
-   ✨ Emphasize user readability
-   ✨ Friendly documentation
-   ✨ Updates rapidly

## The "tidyverse"

-   ‼️ Extra installs over "base R"
-   ‼️ Very different syntax than "base R"
-   ‼️ Updates rapidly

## The "tidyverse"

-   🧭 Only install/load the functions/packages you need
-   🧭 Be aware that others may be unfamiliar; comment your code well
-   🧭 Keep track of your package versions
-   🧭 Software developers, keep an eye on changes!

## Tidy data in R

Let's install some packages:

``` r
install.packages("dplyr") # dataframe manipulation
install.packages("tidyr") # "reshaping" data
install.packages("palmerpenguins") # open teaching dataset
```
