## Review of last session

-   What questions do you have?
-   What happened as you were trying to re-organize projects or R code?
    -   Victories?
    -   Stumbling blocks?

## Learning objectives

-   Understand your computer's *file system*
-   Understand the what and why of the shell command-line interface
-   Use the CLI to navigate your computer's file system
-   Use the shell and file system navigation within RStudio
-   Know your options for finding help

## How well do you know your file system?

## Example file system

## Example file system

## How do you navigate your file system?

-   Searching
-   Point and click
-   "Go to path"

## How do we navigate the file system *programmatically*?

-   A script can't point and click!
-   We need a system for moving around our file system through written commands.

## What is the shell?

-   Command-line interface, in contrast to a GUI
-   Useful for navigating the file system
-   ...and for automating large tasks (e.g. renaming, moving files)
-   ...*and* for running programs that may not have a GUI
-   ...**and** for interfacing with remote computers (e.g. the HPC)

## Shell in this workshop

-   git/GitHub (next 2 lessons)
-   Navigating your file system
-   Quarto (lesson 2)

## Let's get set up!

-   macOS comes with a shell (usually Bash or zsh) built-in

-   Windows need to install GitBash (includes Bash shell and git, which we will use later)

-   Breakout rooms

    -   Mac users go with Eric
    -   Windows users go with Renata

## Data download

-   Download `shell-lesson-data.zip`
    -   Instructions here: <https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/index.html#download-files>
-   Save it to your Desktop and unzip it.

## Coding time

-   RStudio panes
-   Set up Terminal in RStudio
-   Navigation using Terminal and Files pane

## Syntax of a shell command

## Coding time

-   Synchronize working directories between Terminal, Files Pane, and R working directory

## Coding time

-   Use an RStudio project to simplify working directories
-   Copy `shell_lesson_data` to your R project

## Getting help

``` bash
ls --help
man ls
```

## Getting help

``` bash
git --help
```

## Takeaways

-   The shell is a command-line interface to the computer
-   The file system the shell sees is the *same* as your File Explorer tab
-   We can use the shell from the Terminal pane in RStudio
-   Find help from built-in manual pages, Google, (maybe) AI tools, or community

# Break

## Reproducibility colloquim check-in

-   Breakout rooms of 3-4

## Check-in questions {.smaller}

-   What project are you going to be focusing on for the reproducibility colloquim?
-   In which areas do you think it will benefit the most from a makeover?
    -   Project organization
    -   Collaboration practices (git, github)
    -   Code efficiency and robustness (functions, iteration)
    -   Documentation
-   What kinds of support will help you make those improvements?

## Homework for next time

-   Read ["Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?"](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/)
-   Create a diagram of your file system and note your most frequently used directories
