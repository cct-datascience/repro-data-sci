## Review & Homework

::: incremental
-   If you turned an existing project into a git repo, how did it go?

-   Ways to create a git repo:

    -   run `git init` from the command line inside of project directory
    -   create a new RStudio project with "use git" checked
    -   run `usethis::use_git()` in the R console in a RStudio project
:::

## Today's goals

1.  Practice using git with RStudio
2.  Explore commit history
3.  Learn how to tell git to ignore files
4.  Put a local repo on GitHub
5.  Use `git push` and `git pull` to synchronize with GitHub

## Working with git in RStudio (Live Coding)

The most common git commands can be used with the RStudio GUI.

## Ignoring files {.smaller}

-   If you created an RStudio project with git enabled, you should have a top-level `.gitignore`
-   Use this file (or create one) to stop git/GitHub from tracking...
    -   large files, especially if not plain text
    -   files with sensitive data
    -   unnecessary files (e.g. `.DS_Store`)

## Exercise

Modify `.gitignore` to exclude all files ending in `.pdf` from git tracking.

::: notes
-   All contributors have a local copy of the repo.
-   You might also have a copy in multiple places (on multiple computers, on university HPC).
-   GitHub has a central repo that allows you to synchronize and merge work from multiple sources.
-   You can also access the repo through github.com web UI

## Connect With GitHub (Live Coding)

-   Set up your computer to "talk" to GitHub with steps in `git_sitrep()`
-   Connect your local git repo to a remote GitHub repo with `use_github()`
-   Explore the GitHub interface

## Work With RStudio and GitHub (Live Coding)

-   Push local changes to GitHub
-   Pull GitHub changes to local

## Resources

-   #git channel in UA Data Science Slack

-   [`usethis::use_github()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_github.html)

## Your Tasks

-   Put your research compendium on GitHub (e.g. with `use_github()`) and share the link in our Slack channel (if it can be made public)
-   Explore other research compendia shared in Slack
