It opens to a web page where you can download a folder with R code, data, and documentation about the code and data. The page also has detailed information about how to cite the code and data. You open the folder in R Studio and you are prompted to install all the packages you need to run the code. You open the analysis code script and hit “run”. All the code runs perfectly with no errors, creating all the figures, tables, and statistics used in the paper. You scroll through the well-formatted R code and understand from the authors’ comments exactly what the code does and how to adapt it to your work.\n\n\n\n\nWe want to help you make this story a reality for someone else!\n\nIncluding future you!"
