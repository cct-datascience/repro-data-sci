title: Reproduciblity and Data Science in R
subtitle: "Fall 2023"

Welcome!
This is a website for the Fall reproducibility workshop series!
This text needs to be updated with links and a brief explanation!

## Schedule (tentative)

We'll meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 11am to 1pm via Zoom (link)

<!-- Edit by editing schedule.csv.  To add links, use markdown [text](url) separated by commas. This code turns that into a bulleted list. -->

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(gt)
read_csv("schedule.csv") |>
  select(-Notes) |> 
  #turn comma separated list into markdown bullet points
  mutate(
    Links = str_replace(Links, ", ", "\n- ") |> 
      str_replace("^", "- ")
  ) |>
  gt() |>
  fmt_markdown(Links) |> 
  fmt_date(Date, date_style = "MEd") |> 
  sub_missing() |> 
  cols_align("left") |> 
  cols_width(
    Lesson ~ pct(10),
    Date ~ pct(15),
    Theme ~ pct(20),
    Topic ~ pct(35),
    Links ~ pct(20)
  )
```

## Code of Conduct

<!--# we should probably create one more specific to teaching situations.  Contributor Covenant not really appropriate here-->

> In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Read our full [code of conduct](https://github.com/cct-datascience/.github/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and please report any violations or concerns to the course instructors or to Kristina Riemer ([kristinariemer\@arizona.edu](mailto:kristinariemer@arizona.edu)).
