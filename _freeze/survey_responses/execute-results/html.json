I have no previous experience with git or GitHUB and still need practice.  At the very least, this is something that I am starting to understand enough to pursue and engage with in the future.\n- I have converted R scripts for a couple of projects into R.projects. It's more organized now and easier to navigate the different folders.\n- We have certain datasets that we consistently use across multiple projects and updates where there are some straightforward data cleaning tasks-- I'm planning to write a few functions to further systematize some of our data cleaning (instead of copy-pasting cleaning code which has been my practice up until now).\n- I created an RStudio project for my thesis work and will primarily manipulate and manage my data through R.\n- I share a gitlab repo with my coworkers.\n- I am actually using R markdown to document my data analysis steps for my upcoming papers.\n\n\n## 2023 (n = 6)\n\n### Pre vs. post self-assessment\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](survey_responses_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](survey_responses_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Free Response\n\n\n####  Which of the following tools that we covered during the workshop have you already incorporated into your research that you were not using prior to the workshop?\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|useAlready                 |  n|\n|:--------------------------|--:|\n|GitHub                     |  3|\n|dplyr                      |  3|\n|Quarto                     |  2|\n|README                     |  2|\n|RStudio Projects           |  2|\n|Terminal window in RStudio |  2|\n|git                        |  2|\n|if statements              |  2|\n|R functions                |  1|\n|for loops / map functions  |  1|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n####  Which of the following tools that we covered during the workshop do you plan to incorporate into your research within six months after the last workshop session?\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|usePlanned                 |  n|\n|:--------------------------|--:|\n|Quarto                     |  6|\n|R functions                |  6|\n|for loops / map functions  |  6|\n|if statements              |  6|\n|GitHub                     |  4|\n|README                     |  4|\n|RStudio Projects           |  4|\n|Terminal window in RStudio |  4|\n|dplyr                      |  4|\n|git                        |  4|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n####  If you selected any of the options in the previous question, please give one concrete example of how you will implement one of these tools in your research.\n\n- I have RNA-se data for different treatments. Using functions and for loops will help me analyze data faster and in a reproducible way. And using quarto will help me keep all the information at one place.\n- using github to track changes & not have multiple versions of rscripts saved, getting data/code publication ready\n- I will clean/wrangle my data using dplyr\n- I would like to introduce Quarto to my team in order to keep research compendiums more organized.\n- I have been sharing code on github with my mentor\n- Convert to Quarto for document my analysis.\n",
