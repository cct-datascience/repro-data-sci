    "text": "Workshop Overview\n\nPurpose\nTo introduce CALS researchers to better practices for sharing their code and results, managing their projects, and improving reproducibility of their computational work. Learners who already use R and RStudio will get the most out of this workshop.\n\n\nInstructional objectives\n\nShare & collaborate\n\nLearn how to do version control for code and data files\nTools: shell, git & GitHub via the RStudio terminal pane\n\nManage & organize\n\nLearn how to organize projects and use coding better practices\nTools: RStudio projects\n\nRepeat & reproduce\n\nLearn to repeat coding tasks more effectively and refactor code to be more reusable and reproducible\nTools: base R\n\nClean & plot\n\nLearn to use tidyverse tools to modify and visualize data\nTools: dplyr/tidyr/ggplot2\n\nDocument & publish\n\nLearn how to write project READMEs and publish reports\nTools: markdown, Rmarkdown files, RPubs, RStudio Connect, GitHub\n\n\n\n\nGeneral structure\nThis workshop was originally taught as a series of 8 two-hour virtual sessions, meeting twice a week for four weeks. We have now added two sessions, such that the workshop series can extend for 8, 9, or 10 sessions.\nLesson 4 is an optional extension to explore the foundations of collaborating on GitHub, including forking, remotes, and pull requests. Lessons 6 thru 9 are now modular, meaning that they are independent of each other and can be mixed and matched depending on learner interest.\nRelatively small workshop size (&lt; 15) helped keep one-on-one troubleshooting manageable for two instructors.\nThe workshop format is primarily code-along, with some sessions that include more discussion and demonstration. We use R/RStudio for the entire workshop. Students should install R and RStudio prior to the first class."

More difficult to explain and set up, but doesn’t expire and applies to all repos.\nPAT method. Easier to set up, but requires additional R packages and is recommended to set to expire.\n\nProceed to connecting local repository to GitHub repository; GitHub repository must be empty\nCreate new repository entitled repro-DS-workshop on GitHub; can include README, license, and .gitignore. Clone locally to wherever course materials are organized\nShow how checking out a branch literally changes the local files\n\n\n\n\nTeaching notes\n\nPractice another add-commit cycle after creating the .gitignore\nIf ssh -T git@github.com doesn’t work, could be an issue with OpenSSH.

It opens to a web page where you can download a folder with R code, data, and documentation about the code and data. The page also has detailed information about how to cite the code and data. You open the folder in R Studio and you are prompted to install all the packages you need to run the code. You open the analysis code script and hit “run”. All the code runs perfectly with no errors, creating all the figures, tables, and statistics used in the paper. You scroll through the well-formatted R code and understand from the authors’ comments exactly what the code does and how to adapt it to your work.\n\n\n\n\nWe want to help you make this story a reality for someone else!"

The packages I use most often are Seurat, ggplot2, ggpubr, GSVA, and scGSVA for data analysis and visualization. I look at DEGs, pathway analysis from GSEA, and am wanting to learn things like ligand-receptor analysis and CellChat. I am currently working on a heavily-bioinformatics based immunometabolism project in radiation damaged salivary glands - we are using select GSEA kegg and hallmark pathways to understand how radiation is altering inflammatory and metabolic pathways, how these pathways are changing in specific subpopulations of immune cells, and how this may relate to chronic salivary gland dysfunction.\n\n\nIf you’ve tried to learn some of these skills before, what were some obstacles in incorporating them into your research?\nOne thing that has been difficult to learn is how to manipulate the data into the correct format (data frame vs matrix vs list vs dataset etc) with the appropriate columns/rows in order to do the desired analysis. Another obstacle is that I have little experience with github - I have put so much of my effort into learning R and I haven’t put the same effort into learning github. I know the basics but need to understand it better as I start working on bigger/more collaborative projects. Something I also struggle with is keeping all of my files organized - I use a “project” file in R with data/scripts/output folders but struggle to keep my files as organized as I would like.\n\n\nHow do you envision applying what you will learn in this workshop series to your on research? Provide specific examples.\nUnderstanding and implementing version control will help me stay more organized - I tend to save everything and have multiple scripts for each figure/set of figures because I’m scared of losing them. I am also wanting to improve my programming skills - there are some ideas I have for figures (for example: plotting the top 5 different pathways in each cell type following radiation and the top 5 differentially expressed genes in each of these pathways, receptor/ligand analysis, upstream receptor analysis) that I would like to be able to do entirely on my own. I am almost always able to get started and come up with a preliminary idea of what the figure will look like, but I want to be able to fine tune the details and be able to make the exact figure I have in my head. Lastly, I want to understand Rmarkdown better - I am going to start working on a new bioinformatics project in my lab in the next ~6 months and would like to have Rmarkdown files for the code so that others in my lab & collaborators can more easily follow along & add their input. Further, some of my scripts have dozens of # lines in R with notes about what the code does, the data I’m using, and the analysis I’m trying to run - sometimes they get lost in the shuffle and it can be hard to find exactly what I’m looking for. Being able to have the code in an Rmarkdown file would make this less confusing for me and coworkers/collaborators I’m sending the scripts to."
