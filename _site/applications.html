<p>I am collecting environment data from within Biosphere 2’s tropical rain forest. I will need to use this along with my data logger information to produce a report that will be able to be compared to very limited previous work. The previous work does not share data, calculations, data analysis methods. Ideally, I would like to lay a framework for future work that others could use to take a more standardized approach to these types of experiments. This will allow for a more direct comparison between experiments.</p>

<p>I’ll utilize this knowledge to increase my productivity overall. I’m also interested in quality control and reproducibility, especially when it involves teamwork. My research agenda on causal inference is quite data-intensive, so I must keep honing my data management skill set. As a passionate R educator, I can tell that people are more attracted to the programming arena when they learn that R benefits -e.g., reproducibility- go well beyond mere data crunching.</p>

<p>I use R for conducting some analyses, manipulating data and making figures. This often involves plotting annotating phylogenies and data associated with them. I have been experimenting with reformatting data and writing functions in R, but am still very much a beginner at these tasks.</p>

<p>I will be finishing grad school in two years, and I need to get better at coding, organizing my code and analyses, and making them publicly available before I do. I specifically expect to apply these skills to species distribution modelling and biogeography as well as a population genetics project. I would also like to be able to write functions for extracting data from online databases (particularly chromosome counts), cleaning and processing and analyzing the data. Finally, I will be sequencing and analyzing a number of plant genomes (and making associated figures) through a combination of python and R.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-some-common-tasks-you-currently-use-r-for-14">What are some common tasks you currently use R for?</h4>
<p>I use R largely for analyzing bulk and single cell RNA sequencing data. The packages I use most often are Seurat, ggplot2, ggpubr, GSVA, and scGSVA for data analysis and visualization. I look at DEGs, pathway analysis from GSEA, and am wanting to learn things like ligand-receptor analysis and CellChat. I am currently working on a heavily-bioinformatics based immunometabolism project in radiation damaged salivary glands - we are using select GSEA kegg and hallmark pathways to understand how radiation is altering inflammatory and metabolic pathways, how these pathways are changing in specific subpopulations of immune cells, and how this may relate to chronic salivary gland dysfunction.</p>

<p>One thing that has been difficult to learn is how to manipulate the data into the correct format (data frame vs matrix vs list vs dataset etc) with the appropriate columns/rows in order to do the desired analysis. Another obstacle is that I have little experience with github - I have put so much of my effort into learning R and I haven’t put the same effort into learning github. I know the basics but need to understand it better as I start working on bigger/more collaborative projects. Something I also struggle with is keeping all of my files organized - I use a “project” file in R with data/scripts/output folders but struggle to keep my files as organized as I would like.</p>

<p>Understanding and implementing version control will help me stay more organized - I tend to save everything and have multiple scripts for each figure/set of figures because I’m scared of losing them. I am also wanting to improve my programming skills - there are some ideas I have for figures (for example: plotting the top 5 different pathways in each cell type following radiation and the top 5 differentially expressed genes in each of these pathways, receptor/ligand analysis, upstream receptor analysis) that I would like to be able to do entirely on my own. I am almost always able to get started and come up with a preliminary idea of what the figure will look like, but I want to be able to fine tune the details and be able to make the exact figure I have in my head. Lastly, I want to understand Rmarkdown better - I am going to start working on a new bioinformatics project in my lab in the next ~6 months and would like to have Rmarkdown files for the code so that others in my lab &amp; collaborators can more easily follow along &amp; add their input. Further, some of my scripts have dozens of # lines in R with notes about what the code does, the data I’m using, and the analysis I’m trying to run - sometimes they get lost in the shuffle and it can be hard to find exactly what I’m looking for. Being able to have the code in an Rmarkdown file would make this less confusing for me and coworkers/collaborators I’m sending the scripts to.</p>

<p>Data analysis for evaluation projects that we conduct. There are more proficient R users in our group, so much of my current work in R is amending and updating code that they wrote.</p>

<p>Lack of regular use of new skills has led to their atrophy. I default to letting the more proficient coders do the coding. Helpful for efficient work flow, but I would like to make sure that I have the skills to continue that work.</p>

<p>The more-expert R users in our group may have future life events that take them away from our group. I’d like to be functional in using (and making necessary updates to) the robust code they’ve written to do things like pull and process census data so that we could continue to do our needs assessments and related work processing secondary data for descriptive use by Cooperative Extension and community partners. Two members of our team took this class last year, so they have been working on making their processes replicable, but if they leave, there is no one currently able to pick up that baton.</p>

<p>I am still a novice in using R, because I have largely used other tools more (SPSS, STATA, Excel). I did take an advanced statistics course on structural equation modeling in R, so I can definitely find my way around R code through trial and error.</p>

<p>Organize and name files/folders for a research project - I work on a team with many collaborative projects. Part of the impetus for taking this course is for my team to get on the same page for data management conventions because we’ve had individual people save things in ways that work for them but don’t work for others and aren’t sustainable.</p>

<p>On my team, I am much more likely to play the role of visualizing, interpreting and writing about the data that is analyzed. However, this workshop series will be really critical for my ability to help establish systems to better organize our data, for my ability to go into the data files of the data analysts on my team and make sense of the work they are doing, and to conduct more efficient data analysis on the projects where I hold that role that can be easily interpreted and handed off to other team members.</p>

<p>Political science is increasingly cautious about the replication of research. This workshop will help me learn advanced skills in this area.

<p>I want to incorporate all the skills and lessons from this workshop into practical tools and reproduceable research. Two projects I am working on now include bringing disparate source data (County GIS and County Assessor tables) together with an API and measures differences with some code; and exploring stat analysis of an old data set from Robert Putnam’s book Bowling Alone, including ggplot2 tools. Finally, I want to publish these on my own website.</p>

<p>I envision using the skills from this workshop directly in my research by gaining greater autonomy, confidence, and control over my skills in R. Specific applications would include data wrangling and analysis, and developing reproducible code so that any findings that I present or publish are documented at the highest level of standards for reproducible research.</p>
